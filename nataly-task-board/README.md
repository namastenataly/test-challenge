## Naaly Task Board

## Description

The goal of this challenge was to create a simple task board application that allows a team to manage project tasks by modifying starter code. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. When given a task board to manage a project, when you open the task board, then the list of project tasks is displayed in columns representing the task progress state (Not Yet Started, In Progress, Completed). When you view the task board for the project, each task is color coded to indicate whether it is nearing the deadline (yellow) or is overdue (red). When you click on the button to define a new task, you can enter the title, description and deadline date for the new task into a modal dialog. When you click the save button for that task, then the properties for that task are saved in localStorage. When you drag a task to a different progress column, then the task's progress state is updated accordingly and will stay in the new column after refreshing. When you click on the delete button for a task, the task is removed from the task board and will not be added back after refreshing. When you refresh the page, the saved tasks persist.
